Urban areas tend to have more drivers and rides than suburban and rural areas.

Although rural areas tend to have the fewest amount of rides per city, 
those rides tend to be more expensive than those in suburban or urban areas, 
probably because they are longer distance rides or because there are fewer available drivers.

As cities get larger, ride fares tend to be less. This could be because more available drivers, 
or possibly rides are shorter because those cities may have a smaller footprint.
